For running the app in debug mode (without installing the service), set the environnement variable `DEBUG=1` at runtime.



- On Windows, if you want to build the project, you will just need the `SDK` of [dotnet 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0). 
- On Linux, you will need a [JDK](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/17).

The needed commands can be found in CI directory.
