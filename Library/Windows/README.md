Use C# code in the JVM.

The Cpp project will serve as a proxy between C# and Kotlin.

The C# project is used to retrieve data and set controls. His output must be in the bin directory of the JVM. I created a script in FanControl app to do so automatically, so you don't need to change the output directory

Both project use CLR.

There is another branch called dotnet6, witch is the same implementation in Dotnet6, but it don't work for now

More hardware library can be added in the future,
OSD sensor is not actived for now.
